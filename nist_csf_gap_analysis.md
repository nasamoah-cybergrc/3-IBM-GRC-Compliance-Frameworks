# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) – Gap Analysis (Sample)

This document demonstrates how to perform a basic **gap analysis** against the five NIST CSF functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

---

## 1. Objective
To assess how well an organization’s existing security policies and controls align with the NIST CSF framework.

---

## 2. Framework Overview
| Function | Description | Example Controls |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Identify** | Understand assets, data, and risks. | Asset inventory, risk assessments |
| **Protect** | Implement safeguards to protect critical assets. | Access control, awareness training |
| **Detect** | Identify cybersecurity events quickly. | Monitoring, alerting, SIEM |
| **Respond** | Act to contain and mitigate incidents. | Incident response plans |
| **Recover** | Maintain resilience and restore operations. | Backup, lessons learned |

---

## 3. Gap Analysis (Example)
| Function | Existing Policy Coverage | Gap Identified | Recommended Action |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Identify | 60% | Missing asset classification | Create asset inventory and tagging policy |
| Protect | 70% | Inconsistent MFA usage | Standardize MFA enforcement across departments |
| Detect | 50% | No formal log review | Implement weekly SIEM review process |
| Respond | 40% | No updated IR plan | Develop and test an incident response plan |
| Recover | 30% | No documented recovery plan | Draft and test disaster recovery procedures |

## 4. Key Takeaways
- The NIST CSF provides a flexible baseline for any organization.  
- Regular gap assessments improve governance maturity.  
- Future improvement: align NIST CSF controls with ISO 27001 risk register for a unified compliance view.
