# ISO 27001 Risk Register (Sample)

A simplified example showing how an organization can record and track information security risks following ISO 27001 Annex A controls.

| Risk ID | Asset | Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Control (Annex A) | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| R1 | Employee credentials | Phishing emails | Medium | High | High | A.9.2 User access management | Mitigated |
| R2 | Company laptops | Data loss or theft | Medium | Medium | Medium | A.8.3 Asset management | Monitoring |
| R3 | Internal network | Malware infection | High | High | High | A.12.2 Protection from malware | Mitigated |
| R4 | Cloud data storage | Misconfiguration | Medium | High | High | A.14.2 Security in development and support processes | Open |
